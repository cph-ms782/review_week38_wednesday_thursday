### The facade and the matching endpoints
 1) Use our start code as the starting point for this exercise. Initially, just skip the steps related to Travis and Deployment. It will provide you with a starting point for the Rest Assured tests you have to write.

 2) Create a person database and, either use your existing, or create a new test database for this exercise.  
_***Person DB created on localhost**_

 3) Implement a facade class that implements the IPersonFacade given above. Initially just add dummy methods, since we like you to implement the methods, step-by-step, including their matching REST-endpoints. When you implement the methods, make sure to create corresponding JUnit tests.

 4) Complete the GET methods in the facade, and implementing matching REST endpoints. Test via a browser or Postman (Rest Assured will be requested later).  

 5) Complete the addPerson(..) method in the facade, and implement a matching REST endpoint. Test using Postman  

 6) Complete the editPerson(..) method in the facade, and implement a matching REST endpoint. Test using Postman  

 7)  Complete the deletePerson(..) method in the facade, and implement a matching REST endpoint. Test using Postman
